This project provides aggregated APIs to check if CKB Explorer, CKB Faucet, Godwoken Explorer, and CKB public nodes are working properly.

The entries of APIs are placed in `/pages/api/**/*`

### Env

Env is required to run the project, rename `.env.example` to `.env.local` would work, but setting them in the host is a better choice.
